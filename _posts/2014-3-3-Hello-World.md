title: Welcome to my life!

Hi! My name is Nate Burger! I currently live in the big city, Des Moines, Iowa. I received two Bachelor's of Science Degrees in Management Information Systems and Supply Chain Management in December 2016 from Iowa State University that I put to use as a Business Systems Analyst at Ruan Transportation. My day to day focus is on End User Support, Configuration of the User Interface, and IT Continuous Improvement.

As I have kicked off my career I have found a passion for routine and travel. This site is an attempt for me to get better at both of those things, while working on my development skills.
