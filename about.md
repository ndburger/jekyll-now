Just a kid trying to make an impact. Lifelong student of the world. You can usually find me in front of a computer screen, out with friends, or becoming one with nature.

### More Information

Looking for my next adventure. Always looking to learn and connect. Please drop me a line if you want to discuss literally anything with me. I am an advocate for proper mental health treatment and am willing to be an outlet for anyone who needs it.
