# Raising Canes

The beauty of Raising Cane's is the simplicity of it all. It really comes down to two options, Chicken fingers or chicken fingers on bread. From there you can decide how many fingers you want, to get extra sauce or not, and what you are having to drink. It is an extremely low stress decision, which is why it is my ultimate stop when I am dealing with a bout of [@SundayScaries](twitter.com/SundayScaries).

My go to is the wonderful Box Combo, extra Cane's Sauce, and a Dr. Pepper to drink, or something. This gift from God comes with four (4) chicken fingers, a warm piece of Texas Toast, fresh cole slaw, one (1) helping of Cane's Sauce (gotta get extra), a generous helping of fries, and a drink of your choice. I usually go with Dr. Pepper to settle my stomach a bit, but I highly recommend the tea and/or lemonade if you're into delicious made-in-store drinks.
